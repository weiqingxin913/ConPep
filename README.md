# ConPep: Prediction of peptide contact maps with pre-trained biological language model and multi-view feature extracting strategy

The accurate prediction of peptide contact maps remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in obtaining the interactive information between residues on short sequences. To address this challenge, we propose ConPep, a deep learning framework designed for predicting the contact map of peptides based on sequences only. To sufficiently incorporate the sequential semantic information between residues in peptide sequences, we introduce a pre-trained biological language model called ProtT5, and transfer prior knowledge from large scale databases to the peptide contact map prediction. Additionally, to extract and integrate sequential local information and residue-based global correlations, our model incorporates Bi-GRU and attention mechanisms to obtain multi-view features and thus enhance the accuracy and robustness of our prediction. Comparative results on independent tests demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods even with short peptides. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance at the sequence level, suggesting the robust ability of our model compared with the MSA analysis-based methods. We expect it can be meaningful research for facilitating the wide use of our method.
